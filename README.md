## Superstore Sales Analysis
### Introduction
Superstore is a retail company based in the United States specializing in Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology products.  The target market for the business includes individual consumers, corporations, and home offices. 

This project identifies the Superstore sales trends over four years from 2011 – 2014, the performance of different product categories, areas for improvement, and growth potential.
### Dataset
The dataset for this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jr2ngb/superstore-data). 
### Key Questions
•	What is the sales trend in 4 years (2011-2014)?

•	Which category is best-selling and most profitable?

•	Which are the best-selling Subcategories?

•	Which customer segment is most profitable?

•	Which region is the most profitable?

•	Which state has the highest number of sales?

### Who is Reading this Analysis?
•	We assume that the Super Store is a family business and is owned by 1 or 2 owners who are very invested in their business.

•	Owners are likely not people who are experts in reading charts or interpreting statistical analysis, so our analysis will be in layman's terms and easy to understand.

•	They need the information to make informed decisions on how to boost business profit so, our analysis focuses on finding weaknesses or opportunities and providing recommendations and marketing strategies.
### Findings 
•	Superstore has seen an upward trend in its sales from 2011 to 2014. However, the sales dropped in the first quarter of each year (especially January and February) and peaked in the last quarter of the year. 

•	All three categories – Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology make an almost similar amount of sales. But technology is the best selling and most profitable too. Only minimal quantity is sold as these quantities are on-off purchases that can last 4-5 years. Although Furniture makes similar sales as Technology, it is the least profitable and the quantity sold is at a minimum too. Office Supplies sells the most in terms of quantity as it is a relatively cheap product.

•	Phones and Chairs are the Top 2 best-selling sub-categories. On the other end of the spectrum, Machines, Fasteners, Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables make close to zero margins to losses.

•	The consumer segment is the most profitable, followed by Corporate Segment and Home Office. Around 79% of superstore profit comes from the Consumer and Corporate segment.

•	East and West region are the most profitable.

•	California has the highest sales followed by New York and Texas.
### Recommendations
•	The company should avoid stocking too much inventory for the first quarter and prepare for the higher demand at the end of the year.

•	The best-selling and most profitable category is Technology. Phones and chairs are the highest-selling sub-categories. Superstores can bundle these more profitable sub-categories with fewer products such as Bookcases and Tables to offset losses.

•	Home Offices customers, these people might be busy with work and less likely to spend time selecting individual products, so create a Home Office package with products used for offices such as a table, chairs, phones, copiers, storage, label, fasteners, and bookcases.

•	Consumer and Corporate Segment brings 79% of the company’s profit. Target them, especially customers from the East and by introducing special promotions and bundles for mass Consumers and Home Offices and sending promotional emails or flyers.
